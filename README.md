Various stuff related to using the Microsoft Arc Mouse in Linux.

* If you find the **page up / page down touch areas** on the touch strip
  annoying, then check out the
  [disable-pageupdown](disable-pageupdown scripts).

* Missing a **single-tap middle-click**? You may be interested in the
  hacky—but working—solution I cobbled together in the
  [middle-click](middle-click subdirectory).

  _Note: Don't disable the page up / page down touch areas if you're using
  this. These two hacks aren't compatible._

* Would you like to **turn off the haptic feedback and sound**? 
  _Sorry_, I don't know of any way to do this in Linux yet. You'll 
  have to install the Microsoft driver on Windows and do it there. 
  The good news is that it remembers this setting, so you can
  “set it and forget it”.
